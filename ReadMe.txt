Title: Simulation Of Rigorous Two-Phase Locking (2PL) Protocol
Course: DBMS MODELS AND IMPLEMENTATION TECHNIQUES - <CSE 5331, Section 001, Summer 2022>

This application is a demonstration and provides some basic details of how Rigorous 2 Phase locking protocol for concurrency control works.
The application is built in Java 7 and does not require any external libraries or tools.
Class methods that implement critical aspect for the simulation of 2PL protocol

a. public void readInstructionsInToObject(String path) {}: 
b. public void displayOperations() {}:
c. public void beginProtocol() {}:
d. public void removeAnyLocksAcquiredByAbortedTransaction(Transaction transaction) {}:
e. public int checkCanAcquireLock(Transaction transaction, Item item, char operationType) {}:

Steps to run the simulation-

Step 1: Update the address of input file as on the local file system on line 432 in the program where object instantiation is being done.

Step 2: Execute the program, the output will be displayed in the console/ terminal.

Thank you.
